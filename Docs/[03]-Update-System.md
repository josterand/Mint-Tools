After restarting, log back into Mint. Now, we will update the packages in Mint. Make sure you have an active internet connection (LAN or WLAN). Open a terminal and type sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y. This will check to update all available packages. Do not modify anything during the update. Once done, reboot your machine.
